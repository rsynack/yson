# Yson
Yson is a json library in C++. You can parse and create json strings in a easy way. A reader expects a stream or string of JSON source, to build a tree structure of JSON in memory. You can navigate in the tree structure created. In addition, it is possible to build a tree structure in code and serialize this in a stream or string.
